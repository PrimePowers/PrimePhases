# PrimePhases
A novel phase-theoretic approach to number theory. By embedding primes on a unit circle via lnp(mod2Ï€), this project uncovers statistically significant density "hotspots" and develops an optimized estimator for the Euler-Mascheroni constant with reduced variance. Theoretical claims are corroborated by extensive, reproducible numerical verification.

### Analysis of the `2t_n` Hypothesis

This repository also contains a separate analysis that empirically disproves the `2t_n` hypothesis. This section provides a dedicated script and data to demonstrate why this model fails both theoretically and in practice.
