# PrimePhases
A novel phase-theoretic approach to number theory. By embedding primes on a unit circle via lnp(mod2Ï€), this project uncovers statistically significant density "hotspots" and develops an optimized estimator for the Euler-Mascheroni constant with reduced variance. Theoretical claims are corroborated by extensive, reproducible numerical verification.
